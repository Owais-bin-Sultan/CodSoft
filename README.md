Task 1:

To-Do List GUI Application in Python

This Python script creates a simple To-Do list application using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter library. The user can add tasks to the list, update existing tasks, delete tasks, clear the entire list, save the tasks to a file, and load tasks from a saved file.

Features:

A graphical window with a To-Do list interface.
Buttons to add, update, delete, and clear tasks.
Buttons to save and load tasks to/from a file.
User-friendly interactions using key bindings.
Task items displayed in a scrollable list.
A copyright label displaying the year and the creator's name.
Usage:

Enter a task in the text entry field and press the "Add" button or press the Enter key to add a new task to the list.
Select a task from the list and press the "Update" button to modify the task's description.
Select a task from the list and press the "Delete" button to remove the selected task.
Press the "Clear" button to clear the entire list.
Press the "Save" button to save the current list of tasks to a file named "todo_list.txt."
Press the "Load" button to load tasks from a previously saved file, if available.
Note: Make sure to place the icon.ico and task1.png files in the same directory as the script to use them as icons and images for the application.

This To-Do list application provides a convenient way for users to manage their tasks in a simple graphical interface. The project demonstrates the use of tkinter for creating GUI applications in Python.


Task 2:


Calculator GUI Application in Python

This is a simple calculator GUI application implemented in Python using the tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, along with a square root operation.

Features:

The calculator GUI provides a user-friendly interface with a display to show the entered expression and the result.
Users can input numbers and perform operations by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
The calculator supports the use of the '^' symbol for exponentiation.
It handles exceptions and displays "Error" if an invalid expression is entered.
The "C" button clears the current expression.
The "X" button removes the last character from the expression.
The "=" button evaluates the expression and shows the result in the display.
Usage:

Run the script.
A calculator window will open, and you can start using it to perform calculations.
Click the buttons with numbers, operators, and "=" to build the expression.
The result will be displayed in the calculator's input field.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
tkinter library
Note:
This calculator is a basic implementation, and it may not handle all complex expressions or error cases. However, it serves as a good starting point to build and customize a more sophisticated calculator application based on specific requirements.

Task 3:

Password Generator GUI Application in Python

This is a password generator GUI application implemented in Python using the tkinter library. The application allows users to generate secure random passwords of a specified length.

Features:

The password generator provides a user-friendly interface with input fields to enter the username and desired password length.
Users can generate a password by clicking the "Generate Password" button, and the result will be displayed in a text area.
The generated password includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters for enhanced security.
The "Reset" button allows users to clear all inputs and the generated password.
Usage:

Run the script.
The password generator window will open, and you can start generating passwords.
Enter your desired username (optional) and the password length in the respective input fields.
Click the "Generate Password" button to get a secure random password of the specified length.
The generated password will be displayed in the text area below.
To reset the inputs and the displayed password, click the "Reset" button or press the "Backspace" key.
The background color of the application title "Password Generator" will change periodically as a simple animation.
Note:

Make sure to provide a valid positive integer for the password length.
The generated passwords are randomly created and do not include any personal information or common patterns.
